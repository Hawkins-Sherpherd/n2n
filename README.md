# Edge node

You need to start an edge node on each host you want to connect with the *same*
community.

Become root
```
./edge -f -d n2n0 -c mynetwork -u 99 -g 99 -k encryptme -m 00:FF:12:34:56:78 -a 192.168.254.1 -s 255.255.255.0 -l a.b.c.d:xyw
```
or
```
N2N_KEY=encryptme ./edge -f -d n2n0 -c mynetwork -u 99 -g 99 -m 00:FF:12:34:56:78 -a 192.168.254.1 -s 255.255.255.0 -l a.b.c.d:xyw
```

Once you have this worked out, you can drop the `-f` option to make edge detach
and run as a daemon.

Note that `-u`, `-g` and `-f` options are not available for Windows.

When running edge on Windows a compatile TAP network interface is required, the driver is included in the
[OpenVPN installer](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html). If multiple TAP adapters
exist in the system one can be specified using the `-d` parameter and the "Friendly Name" of the adapter
(the one shown in the Network Adapter List in the Control Pannel). Currently not spaces are allowd when
using `-d`, but Network Adapters can be renamed to not contain spaces.

# Supernode

You need to start the supernode once, it does not require any privileges.

1. `./supernode -l 1234 -v -f`

# IPv6 Support

This version of edge and supernode support transport inbetween over IPv6.

Start supernode either in IPv6 or IPv4 and IPv6 mode, by specifing `-6` or `-4` and `-6` switches.

```
./supernode -6 -f
```
or
```
./supernode -4 -6 -f
```

The default setting is to launch supernode in IPv4 only mode.

To use IPv6 with edge only the address needs to be specified for
the supernode.

```
./edge -f -v [ other options ] -l [2001:aa00:bb00::1]:1234
```

If DNS name resolution is required, then use the `-6` parameter,
to force a IPv6 address to be resolved.

```
./edge -f -v [ other options ] -6 -l example.com:1234
```


# IPv6 Support (Inner)

n2n supports the carriage of IPv6 packets within the n2n tunnel.

```
./edge -f -v [ other options ] -a 192.168.254.1 -s 255.255.255.0 -A fdf0:aa01:bb02::1/64
```

# Considerations of running edge as system service

## Use net_admin capabilities (LINUX)

This version of edge is capabilties aware and uses the `NET_ADMIN` capability if it is found
in its permissive set.

To use this feature set as root the admin capability:
```
setcap cap_net_admin+p ./edge
```

Edge can now be run as any user that has executive permission for edge.


## Running As a Daemon (UNIX)

Unless given `-f` as a command line option, edge will call `daemon(3)` after
successful setup. This causes the process to fork a child which closes `stdin`,
`stdout` and `stderr` then sets itself as process group leader. When this is done,
the edge command returns immediately and you will only see the edge process in
the process listings, eg. from `ps` or `top`.

If the edge command returns 0 then the daemon started successfully. If it
returns non-zero then edge failed to start up for some reason. When edge starts
running as a daemon, all logging goes to syslog `daemon.info` facility.


## Dropping Root Privileges and SUID-Root Executables (UNIX)

The edge node uses superuser privileges to create a TAP network interface
device. Once this is created root privileges are not required and can constitute
a security hazard if there is some way for an attacker to take control of an
edge process while it is running. Edge will drop to a non-privileged user if you
specify the `-u <uid>` and `-g <gid>` options. These are numeric IDs. Consult `/etc/passwd`.

You may choose to install edge SUID-root to do this:

1. Become root
2. `chown root:root edge`
3. `chmod +s edge`

Any user can now run edge. You may not want this, but it may be convenient and
safe if your host has only one login user.

## Systemd Service (LINUX)

Examples for an systemd service file are provided in the systemd/ folder.
The edge service uses AmbientCapabilities to set the net_admin capability
to run edge as a dynamically created user.

Systemd requires a Linux Kernel 4.3 or greater for this feature.


## SCM Service (WINDOWS)

edge and supernode can be installed as a Windows SCM service, consult the [`win32/install.ps1`](win32/install.ps1)
script in the repository.

When running as a service, edge and supernode are not attached to
a console, messages are logged in the Windows Event Log.

The commandline parameters are stored in
`HKLM:\SOFTWARE\n2n\edge\Arguments` and
`HKLM:\SOFTWARE\n2n\supernode\Arguments`.
