.TH supernode 1  "May 19 2018" "n2n-2.2" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
supernode \- n2n supernode daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B supernode [\-l <port>] [\-v] [\-4] [\-6]
.SH DESCRIPTION
N2N is a peer-to-peer VPN system. Supernode is a node introduction registry,
broadcast conduit and packet relay node for the n2n system. On startup supernode
begins listening on the specified UDP port for node registrations, and other
packets to route. The supernode can service any number of communities and routes
packets only between members of the same community. The supernode does not hold
the community encryption key and so cannot snoop or inject packets into the
community.
.PP
Supernode can service a number of n2n communities concurrently. Traffic does not
cross between communities.
.PP
All logging goes to stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-l <port>
listen on the given UDP port. Defaults to 7654
.TP
\-4
bind to the any interface IPv4 address. This is the default.
.TP
\-6
bind to the any interface IPv6 address. This disables IPv4 but it can be combined with
the \-4 switch to allow IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
.TP
\-v
use verbose logging
.TP
\-f
disable daemon mode (UNIX) and run in foreground.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B supernode -l 7654 -v
Start supernode listening on UDP port 7654 with verbose output.
.PP
.SH REMARKS
Additionally supernode opens UDP port 5645 on the IPv4 loopback interface (127.0.0.1).
On this management socket statistical information can be queried, i.e. using
.B socat(1).
.SH RESTART
When supernode restarts it loses all registration information from associated
edge nodes. It can take up to five minutes for the edge nodes to re-register and
normal traffic flow to resume.
.SH EXIT STATUS
supernode is a daemon and any exit is an error
